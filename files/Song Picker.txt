Implement it **without using a checkbox**, while still tracking if the user tapped the **“Tip the Band”** button.

This could work similiar to a karaoke system I imagine.

## ✅ Finalized Implementation: Button-Only Tip Tracking

### 🎵 User Experience:

1. **User selects a song** (can we add a way for them to enter their name so we can announce it for them?)
2. Confirmation screen shows:

   * 🔘 **“Tip the Band on Venmo”**
     (Opens your Venmo link in a new tab: `https://venmo.com/AuggyStyle`)
     ✅ *Silently tracks that the button was clicked*
   * 🔘 **Submit Song Request**

3. If a song is grayed out: display a cheeky or playful “grayed out” confirmation message when a song is selected — something like this:

“Nice pick! We’ll queue it up — and nope, you can’t pick it again 😎”

Or possibly:

“Song selected. That one’s taken — no backsies!”

These messages were meant to appear after someone chooses a song, as a lighthearted confirmation, while also reinforcing that the song is now unavailable. Let me know if you'd like more variations or if you were thinking of a different message.

Create a Queue screen that lists the songs in order of how they were selected.

### 🧠 Behind the Scenes:

* When the **Venmo button is clicked**, the app:

  * Sets a hidden variable: `tip_clicked = true`
* When the user taps **Submit**, Make:

  * Logs the song
  * Logs `Tipped? = true/false` based on whether the Venmo button was tapped
  * Sends SMS including:

    ```
    🎵 Song Request: [Song Name]
    💸 Tipped: ✅ / ❌
    ```

### 🗂️ Airtable Fields:

| Field Name | Type               | Description                     |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Song       | Single line text   | The song requested              |
| Selected?  | Checkbox           | Marked true when selected       |
| Tipped?    | Checkbox or Yes/No | Set to ✅ if Venmo button tapped |

---

### 🔁 Make Scenario:

* Tracks if Venmo button was pressed (client-side or via form prefill)
* Stores `Tipped? = true` in Airtable
* Sends SMS to band with tip status

I'll now finish creating this version, test that the tap is tracked reliably, and place the finished version in your Google Drive folder.


Keep it lean and clean. ✅
